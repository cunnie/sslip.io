      <h3 id="branding">Branding / White Label / Custom Domains</h3>
      <p>sslip.io can be used to brand your own site (you don’t need to use the sslip.io domain). For example, say you
      own the domain “example.com”, and you want your subdomain, “xip.example.com” to have xip.io-style features. To
      accomplish this, set the following three DNS servers as NS records for the subdomain “xip.example.com”</p>
      <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
        <b>Do not use these name servers for general-purpose name resolution</b>; instead, continue to use
        <code>1.1.1.1</code>, <code>8.8.8.8</code>, <code>9.9.9.9</code> or whatever name server you're currently
        using. The sslip.io name servers are not <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_recursive_name_server">public recursive name servers</a>. They will not
        resolve regular domain names (e.g. "<a href="https://google.com">google.com</a>").

      <pre><code>169.254.169.254</code></pre>
      <h3 id="server">But I Want My Own DNS Server!</h3>
      <p>If you want to run your own DNS server, it's simple: you can compile from <a href=
      "https://github.com/cunnie/sslip.io/tree/main/src/sslip.io-dns-server">source</a> or you can use one
      of our <a href="https://github.com/cunnie/sslip.io/releases">pre-built binaries</a>. In the following example, we
      install & run our server within a docker container:</p>
      <pre>
docker run -it --rm fedora
curl -L https://github.com/cunnie/sslip.io/releases/download/2.6.2/sslip.io-dns-server-linux-amd64 -o dns-server
chmod +x dns-server
./dns-server 2&gt; dns-server.log &
dnf install -y bind-utils
dig @localhost 127-0-0-1.sslip.io +short # returns "127.0.0.1"</pre>
      <h3 id="tls">TLS</h3>
      <p>You can acquire TLS certificates for your externally-accessible hosts from certificate authorities (CAs) such
      as Let's Encrypt. The easiest mechanism to acquire a certificate would be to use the <a href=
      "https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#http-01-challenge">HTTP-01 challenge</a>. It requires, at a
      minimum, a web server running on your machine. The <a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy</a> web server is one
      of the most popular examples. For example, if you had a webserver with the IP address 52.0.56.137, you could
      obtain a TLS certificate for "52.0.56.137.sslip.io", or "www.52.0.56.137.sslip.io", or
      "prod.www-52-0-56-137.sslip.io".</p>
      <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
        <b>2021-02-12 Let's Encrypt Rate Limits</b> If your request for an "sslip.io" certificate is <a href=
        "https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/">rate-limited</a>, please open a <a href=
        "https://github.com/cunnie/sslip.io/issues/new/choose">GitHub issue</a> and we'll request a rate-limit
        increase.
      </div>
      <p>If you have procured a wildcard certificate for your branded / white label / custom sslip.io-style subdomain,
      you may install it on your machines for TLS-verified connections.</p>
      <div class="alert alert-warning" data-role="alert">
        <p>When using a TLS wildcard certificate in conjunction with your branded sslip.io style subdomain, you must
        <b>use dashes not dots</b> as separators. For example, if you have the TLS certificate for
        <i>*.xip.example.com</i>, you could browse to https://www-52-0-56-137.xip.example.com/ but not
        https://www.52.0.56.137.xip.example.com/.</p>
      </div>
      <p>if you're interested in acquiring a wildcard certificate for your sslip.io domain, e.g.
      "*.52-0-56-137.sslip.io", the procedure is described <a href=
      "https://github.com/cunnie/sslip.io/blob/main/docs/wildcard.md">here</a>.</p>

      <p>Experimental features can change; don't depend on them.</p>
      <h4 id="whatismyip">Determining Your External IP Address via DNS Lookup</h4>
      <p>You can use sslip.io's DNS servers (<code>ns.sslip.io</code>) to determine your public IP address by querying
      the <code>TXT</code> record of <code>ip.sslip.io</code>:</p>
      <pre>
dig @ns.sslip.io txt ip.sslip.io +short    # sample reply "2607:fb90:464:ae1e:ed60:29c:884c:4b52"
dig @ns.sslip.io txt ip.sslip.io +short -4 # forces IPv4 lookup; sample reply "172.58.35.231"
dig @ns.sslip.io txt ip.sslip.io +short -6 # forces IPv6 lookup; sample reply "2607:fb90:464:ae1e:ed60:29c:884c:4b52"</pre>
      <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
        When querying for your IP address, always <b>include the sslip.io name server</b> (e.g. <i>@ns.sslip.io</i>).
        If omitted, you won't get your IP address; instead, you'll get the IP address of your upstream name server.
      </div>
      <p>This feature was inspired by Google's DNS lookup, i.e. <code>dig txt o-o.myaddr.l.google.com @8.8.8.8
      +short</code>. There are also popular HTTP-based services for determining your public IP address:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="http://icanhazip.com/">icanhazip.com</a> (<a href=
          "https://major.io/2021/06/06/a-new-future-for-icanhazip/">backstory</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://ipify.org/">ipify.org</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://ip4.me/">ip4.me</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://curlmyip.org/">curlmyip.org</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://ifconfig.co/">ifconfig.co</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://ipinfo.io/">ipinfo.io</a> (commercial)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>A big advantage of using DNS queries instead of HTTP queries is bandwidth: querying
      <code>ns-aws.sslip.io</code> requires a mere 592 bytes spread over 2 packets; Querying <a href=
      "https://icanhazip.com/">https://icanhazip.com/</a> requires 8692 bytes spread out over 34 packets—over 14 times
      as much! Admittedly bandwidth usage is a bigger concern for the one hosting the service than the one using the
      service.</p>
      <h4 id="version">Determining The Server Version of Software</h4>You can determine the server version of the
      sslip.io software by querying the TXT record of <code>version.status.sslip.io</code>:
      <pre>
dig @ns-gce.nono.io version.status.sslip.io txt +short
  "2.6.1"
  "2022/11/11-11:39:10-0800"
  "b9f0da8"
</pre>
      <p>The first number, ("2.6.1"), is the version of the sslip.io DNS software, and is most relevant. The other two
      numbers are the date compiled and the most recent git hash, but those values can differ across servers due to the
      manner in which the software is deployed.</p>
      <h4 id="metrics">Server Metrics</h4>You can retrieve metrics from a given server by querying the TXT records of
      <code>metrics.status.sslip.io</code>
      <pre>
dig @ns-aws.sslip.io metrics.status.sslip.io txt +short
  "Uptime: 82059"
  "KV Store: etcd"
  "Blocklist: 2022-07-15 16:40:03-07 2,3"
  "Queries: 6399908 (78.0/s)"
  "Answered Queries: 2202200 (26.8/s)"
  "A: 1974882"
  "AAAA: 87362"
  "TXT Source: 269"
  "TXT Version: 8"
  "TXT KV GET/PUT/DEL: 21/7/7"
  "PTR IPv4/IPv6: 0/0"
  "NS DNS-01: 455"
  "Blocked: 66"
      </pre>
      <h5>Explanation of Metrics</h5>
      <dl>
        <dt>Uptime</dt>
        <dd>The time since the DNS server has been started, in seconds</dd>
        <dt>KV Store</dt>
        <dd>This can be one of two values: "builtin" and "etcd". "builtin" means any changes to key/value are limited
        to that specific DNS server. "etcd" means changes are propagated to all servers whose key-value store is
        "etcd"</dd>
        <dt>Blocklist</dt>
        <dd>
          The first value ("2022-02-26 10:54:21-08") is the date the blocklist was last downloaded. The following two
          numbers are the number of string matches that are blocked (e.g. "raiffeisen" is a string that is blocked if
          it appears in the queried hostname) and the number of CIDR matches that are blocked (e.g. "43.134.66.67/24"
          is blocked). The blocklist can be found <a href=
          "https://github.com/cunnie/sslip.io/blob/main/etc/blocklist.txt">here</a>
        </dd>
        <dt>Queries</dt>
        <dd>This consists of two numbers: The first is the raw number of DNS queries that the server has responded to
        since starting operation, and the second is the first number divided by the uptime (i.e. queries/second)</dd>
        <dt>Answered Queries</dt>
        <dd>This consists of two numbers: the first is the number of queries we responded to with at least one record
        in the answer section, and the second is the first number divided by the uptime (i.e. queries/second). Note
        that the number of answered queries is typically a third or fourth the size of the overall queries. This is
        normal. One reason for this disparity is that often both the IPv4 (A) and IPv6 (AAAA) records will be checked,
        but only one reply will have a record in the answer section . For example, browsing to "127.0.0.1.sslip.io"
        generates two lookups, one with an answer (IPv4), and one without (IPv6). Another reason is that lookups follow
        a chain, e.g. looking up "127.0.0.1.sslip.io" may generate up to four queries for A records ("1.sslip.io",
        "0.1.sslip.io", "0.0.1.sslip.io" and "127.0.0.1.sslip.io"), only the last of which returns a record in the
        answer section. Pro-tip: if you want to shave milliseconds off name resolution, use dashes not dots in your
        hostname (e.g. "10-9-9-30.sslip.io" instead of "10.9.9.30.sslip.io")</dd>
        <dt>A</dt>
        <dd>The number of responses which included an A (IPv4) record since starting operation (e.g. "dig
        127.0.0.1.sslip.io")</dd>
        <dt>AAAA</dt>
        <dd>The number of responses which included an AAAA (IPv6) record since starting operation (e.g. "dig
        --1.sslip.io aaaa")</dd>
        <dt>TXT Source</dt>
        <dd>The number of responses which included a TXT record of the querier's IP address since starting operation
        (e.g. "dig @ns.sslip.io ip.sslip.io txt")</dd>
        <dt>TXT Version</dt>
        <dd>The number of responses which included a TXT record of the DNS's servers version since starting operation
        (e.g. "dig @ns-azure.sslip.io version.status.sslip.io txt")</dd>
        <dt>TXT KV GET/PUT/DEL</dt>
        <dd>
          The number of GET/PUT/DELETEs to the DNS-backed key-value store on our sister site, <a href=
          "https://k-v.io">k-v.io</a>
        </dd>
        <dt>PTR IPv4/IPv6</dt>
        <dd>This consists of two numbers; the first is the number of responses to IPv4 PTR queries
        (<code>1.0.0.127.in-addr.arpa.</code> → <code>127-0-0-1.sslip.io.</code>), the second, IPv6 PTR queries</dd>
        <dt>NS DNS-01</dt>
        <dd>The number of responses which included a delegation of the NS (name server) to satisfy a certificate
        authority's DNS-01 challenge. This lookup is used for generating wildcard certificates from Let's Encrypt and
        other certificate authority. Technically this is not a "successful" query in that we don't return a record in
        the ANSWER section, but we do return an NS record in the AUTHORITY section. (e.g. "dig @ns-gce.sslip.io
        _acme-challenge.192.168.0.1.sslip.io. soa")</dd>

      <p>DNS runs over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol">UDP</a> which has no guaranteed
      delivery, and it’s not uncommon for the packets to get lost in transmission. DNS clients are programmed to
      seamlessly query a different server when that happens. That’s why DNS, by fiat, requires at least two name
      servers (for redundancy). From <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034">IETF (Internet Engineering Task
      Force) RFC (Request for Comment) 1034</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>A given zone will be available from several name servers to insure its availability in spite of host or
        communication link failure. By administrative fiat, we require every zone to be available on at least two
        servers, and many zones have more redundancy than that.</p>
